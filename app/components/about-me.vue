          My main goal is to be able to build full-stack web apps. Using Django and/or Nuxt.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have practiced python scripting since leaving high-school. I picked up Django to be able to add a GUI
          element to my scripts and have grown to quite enjoy building web apps.
        </li>
        <li>
          I primarily focus on building projects around video games I play, primarily management sims as they feature a
          lot of planning that transitions very well to Inventory Asset Management Systems which python is quite accomodating to.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned html in high-school but had more of a fascination with python and backend architecture, as thus most
          of my capabilities are primarily backend focused but I hope to have my frontend skills improve so I can be a well
          rounded full-stack dev.
